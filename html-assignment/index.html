        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, My name is Wang Guoping, and I come from China, I was born on August 6<sup>th</sup>,1991. Now, I am studying <abbr title="Interactive media design">IMD</abbr> at <em>Algonquin College</em>. I have a keen interest in listening to music, which I find to be a wonderful way to relax. Previously, I studied education, and I am excited to learn some new media skills with my course. I chose this course because I believe it is both creative and practical, offering valuable insights and skills that will be useful in my future goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            I manage my time by prioritizing my tasks, breaking them down into manageable steps, and allocating specific time for each activity. The experience of getting in touch with people in my previous studies is quite similar to what I am learning in this course, and I enjoy that. The most important thing now is my course. I need to master the knowledge and skills required for my major, identify my strengths and weaknesses, and complete all learning tasks to the best of my ability. 
        </p>
